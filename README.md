In this repository, I have included some of my important homework assignments completed during the semester.
# canny_edge_detector
In this section, I implemented the Canny edge detector. The Canny edge detection algorithm can be broken down into five steps, and I wrote code for each one:
1. Smoothing
2. Finding gradients
3. Non-maximum suppression
4. Double thresholding
5. Edge tracking by hysteresis
