# computer_vision
In this repository, I have included some of my important homework assignments completed during the semester.
# canny_edge_detector
In this section, I implemented the Canny edge detector. The Canny edge detection algorithm can be broken down into five steps, and I wrote code for each one:
1. Smoothing
2. Finding gradients
3. Non-maximum suppression
4. Double thresholding
5. Edge tracking by hysteresis
# morphological_knowledge
In this section, without using the built-in library functions and by applying morphological knowledge, I extracted the skeletons of the images. Then, by saving the steps of skeleton extraction, I reconstructed the original images from the skeletons.
